# How to start the project 

## Start Docker containers

```

Otheer commands to manage the containers:

docker logs -f leads-db
```

### Stop Docker containers

docker compose down --rmi all

```


## Connect to the database

- contrase√±a: secret

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U leaduser -d leadsdb
```

# Run the application

Compile and package the source code, and then you will be able to run the generated jar,
for see those fo to the target directory. 

```bash
mvn clean package
java -jar target/crm-validation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The application has 2 main entry points:

## CLI client

The command line interface will start automatically when the application starts.

It will start asking you for the lead information, then it will validate it, and finally show you the results by console messages.
               
To execute the CLI client, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--app.cli.enabled=true"
```
                 
## REST API

You can find the SWAGGER specification once the application is running at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

You can also use the REST API to send leads to the application. The API is documented in the SWAGGER specification.

```
curl -X 'POST' \
'http://localhost:8080/api/leads/validate' \
-H 'accept: */*' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "id": "12",
    "name": "j",
    "birthdate": "1990-06-13",
    "email": "a@gmail.com",
    "phoneNumber": "+23342",
    "documentType": "CC",
    "documentNumber": 1234
}'
```

In a success execution you will se a response like this:

```json
{
  "lead": {
    "id": "12",
    "name": "j",
    "birthdate": "1990-06-13",
    "state": "PROSPECT",
    "email": "a@gmail.com",
    "phoneNumber": "+23342",
    "documentType": "CC",
    "documentNumber": 1234
  },
  "validations": {
    "errors": [],
    "valid": true,
    "allErrosInString": ""
  }
}
```

### Manually execute flyway migrations

If you want to manually execute the flyway migrations, you can do it with the following command:
```
mvn flyway:migrate
```

## High Level Architecture

| Layer                  | Responsibilities                                                                   |
| ---------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domain Layer**       | - Core business logic (entities, validation rules, value objects)                  |
| **Application Layer**  | - Orchestrates use cases (e.g., `ValidateLeadUseCase`)                             |
| **Ports (Interfaces)** | - Abstractions for interacting with external systems (e.g., `JudicialRecordsPort`) |
| **Adapters (Infra)**   | - Implementations of ports (stubbed HTTP, mock services, etc.)                     |
| **Presentation Layer** | - CLI input/output and REST uses the application service                           |
| **Testing Layer**      | - Unit tests, validation flow tests, edge case checks                              |
